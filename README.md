## Study Description

This study tests a hypertension program integrating a virtual Collaborative Care Clinic (vCCC), home blood pressure monitoring, and telehealth for lowering blood pressure (BP) in two health systems (University of Kansas Health System [UKHS] and the University of Utah Health [UUtah]). The vCCC is staffed by clinical pharmacists who remotely monitor home BP and use telehealth to work with patients to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to <130 mmHg, as recommended by the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. Eligible patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) are identified automatically through the electronic health record (EHR) during visits to their Primary Care Provider (PCP) and referred for enrollment into the vCCC.
