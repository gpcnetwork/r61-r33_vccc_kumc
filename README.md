# Remote Monitoring and Virtual Collaborative Care for Hypertension Control to Prevent Cognitive Decline (VCCC)

Aggressive management of hypertension (HTN) may represent an important public health strategy for lowering the risk of dementia. Intensive blood pressure (BP) control reduces the incidence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia and slows cognitive decline. Despite this evidence, BP is uncontrolled in 3 out of 4 older adults (65+ years old) with hypertension (HTN). Many barriers interfere with effective BP control: clinicians have a shortage of time, incentives, and resources while patients may lack knowledge and struggle with adherence (cost, dosing, delay in refills, adverse effects) and logistical issues (distance from the clinic or pharmacy, transportation, frequency of clinic visits). We seek to overcome these barriers through a BP lowering intervention that can be reproducibly implemented on a health-system wide scale. 

Our long-term goal is to develop actionable large-scale strategies to prevent dementia. In this study, we will test a pragmatic approach integrated into clinical care at a health system level. We will use remote BP monitoring and a virtual Collaborative Care Clinic (vCCC), staffed by clinical pharmacists, to lower systolic BP (SBP) to <130 mmHg, as recommended by the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. We will use the electronic health record (EHR) to identify and automatically refer potentially eligible patients for enrollment and randomization to either intensive BP control (vCCC) or usual care with education (control). The vCCC is an extension of the PCPâ€™s usual primary care (under a collaborative care agreement). Home BP readings will be securely transferred via a mobile app in real-time to the vCCC. Pharmacists will communicate with patients, use shared decision-making involving the patient and PCP, individualize and modify BP goals, and e-prescribe anti-hypertensives to achieve BP goals.

We hypothesize that health-system wide implementation of remote BP monitoring and management through vCCC can improve BP control in patients with previously uncontrolled HTN.  We also hypothesize that this will in turn slow age-related decline in cognition and reduce cardiovascular events, mortality, and health care utilization.  The study is structured in two phases: initial R61 phase (to demonstrate feasibility and optimize vCCC operations) followed by the R33 phase (type I hybrid implementation-effectiveness study). 


## Study Description

This study tests a hypertension program integrating a virtual Collaborative Care Clinic (vCCC), home blood pressure monitoring, and telehealth for lowering blood pressure (BP) in two health systems (University of Kansas Health System [UKHS] and the University of Utah Health [UUtah]). The vCCC is staffed by clinical pharmacists who remotely monitor home BP and use telehealth to work with patients to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to <130 mmHg, as recommended by the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines. Eligible patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) are identified automatically through the electronic health record (EHR) during visits to their Primary Care Provider (PCP) and referred for enrollment into the vCCC. This repository is to document and share computational resources among collaborators participating in the VCCC studies.
